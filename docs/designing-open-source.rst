==================================
Designing Your Open-Source Project
==================================

Bryan Veloso

The problem
===========

* Designers are picky
* Designers are stubborn
* Designers are just like you (developers)

Pixel perfection === PEP8 perfection
Clarity through interface === clarity through documentation

A designer's ability to code === nosql (things we bicker about)

Designers to developers: "make it work"
Developers to designers: "make it pretty"

Recruiting a Designer
=====================

* Pitch it on github
* Find them on Dribbble
* The hallway track

To My Fellow Designers
======================

* Open source is experiential
* Open source is crucial
* Make yourself known

Hybrids
=======

* Universal translators
* Knowledge exchanges
* Find them, train them
* Learn from hybrids
* Pair with hybrids

Working with Designers
======================

* Time investment
* They need space
* Restrictions and boundaries
* Death to spec work


Design matters to Django so design should matter to you.
